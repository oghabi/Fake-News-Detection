## Fake News Detection
Social media allows news to be shared in real-time and disseminate much quicker than before, without any verification. Fake news can bias the judgments and actions of humans. In this repo, I have implemented various machine learning algorithms to detect fake news in the FNC dataset. The goal is to detect the stance of an article body relative to the article headline.

## Dataset
The dataset is the [FNC-1](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/) and is part of the Fake News Challenge competition.

## Results
[Individual Report](https://github.com/oghabi/Fake-News-Detection/blob/master/Individual%20Report.pdf) is a statistical analysis of the dataset and compares the performance of the various implemented machine learning and deep learning models on the FNC-1 test set. The best model achieved 87% accuracy and FNC score of 80.
